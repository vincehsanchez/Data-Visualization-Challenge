# Data-Visualization_Challenge
1. Compare the performance of drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
2. Generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. 
3. Write top-level summary of the study results.

### Prepare the Data
Run and merge DataFrames into a single DataFrame.

Display data, and remove duplicate time points.

Display the data with removed timepoints.

Use this cleaned DataFrame for the remaining steps.

Display the updated number of unique mice IDs.

### Generate Summary Statistics
Create a DataFrame of summary statistics.
1. A row for each drug regimen.
2. A column for each of the following statistics of tumor volume:
- mean
- median
- variance
- standard deviation
- SEM

### Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts
Generate two bar charts show the total number of rows for each drug regimen and two pie charts that show the distribution of female versus male mice.
- Create the first chart with the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method and second one with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.


### Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot
Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens:
- Capomulin
- Ramicane
- Infubinol
- Ceftamin

Calculate:
- quartiles
- IQR

Determine any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
- Create a grouped DataFrame that shows the last (greatest) time point for each mouse.
- Generate a box plot that shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group.
- Highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.

### Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot
Select a single mouse that was treated with Capomulin.

Generate a line plot of tumor volume versus time point for that mouse.

Generate a scatter plot:
- Mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.

### Calculate Correlation and Regression
Calculate between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen:
1. correlation coefficient
2. linear regression model 

Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
